Multicast RTP to Unicast HTTP stream convertor
==============================================

What is it
----------

This program converts multicast RTP/UDP media into http stream.
It acts as a tiny HTTP server. When client connect,
pre-configured multicast RTP service is choosen by URL.
Program then join pre-configured multicast address and translate
incoming RTP data to HTTP stream.

As an alternative to pre-configured address, there is also a [UDPxy][1]
compatibility mode. If URL looks like `/<rtp|udp>/<multicast address>:<port>`
and UDPxy mode is enabled (which is default), the program joins address
contained in the URL.

It's main purpose is to remotely watch multicast video and audio
broadcast, when your internet connection in the first-mile
(e.g. broadband router) does not support multicast routing.

Main advantage over translating streams in vlc (http://www.videolan.org)
is that multicast group is joined _after_ the HTTP client connects,
and is leaved immediately after HTTP client disconnects. So,
server can be run all the time and consume almost no bandwidth nor CPU
power, until HTTP client connects.
